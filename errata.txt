The contract should be
apply-procedure/k : Proc * ExpVal * Cont -> ExpVal.
Also, "cps-" should precede "let-exp", "letrec-exp",
"if-exp", and "call-exp".

Line 10 (line 4 of the second display):
The last paren should be preceded by ">>", leading to "exp_n>> K) >>)"

Lines 9 and 14 of the final display:
The two closing parentheses should each be preceded by ">>" leading to ">>) >>)"

Line 7 of last display
There is an unmatched set of <<'s and >>'s.
Need to move the '>>' to the next term following an equal sign
and have it follow the "K)"

The type and name say it is for cps-of-diff-exp, but
the code is for cps-of-sum-exp.  So, we need the type:
cps-of-sum-exp : Listof (InpExp) * SimpleExp -> TfExp

Page 223-224
The code for cps-of-let-exp is incorrect, because it puts k-exp inside
the scope of id.  The solution is to translate the 'let' into the immediate
application of a lambda expression.  Then cps-of-exps will make the
needed fresh variables. 

  (define cps-of-let-exp
    (lambda (id rhs body k-exp)
      (cps-of-exp
       (call-exp
        (proc-exp (list id) body)
        (list rhs))
       k-exp)))

The proposed code in Exercise 6.27 suffers from the same error.


Page 223:
The type left off the type of the letrec-body.
It is, of course, just InpExp.  Here is what the type should say.
  ;; cps-of-letrec-exp :
  Listof(Listof(Var)) * Listof(InpExp) * InpExp * SimpleExp -> TfExp

See chapter8/abstract-types-lang/static-data-structures.scm

Page 337 et seq:
The code in
https://github.com/mwand/eopl3/blob/master/chapter9/classes is
inconsistent .  data-structures.scm defines ExpVal to include objects,
with the injector obj-val.  However, the rest of the interpreter
doesn't use obj-val.  Objects are passed around without the wrapper.
The code still works, because method-call-exp doesn't check to see
whether its argument is an object.  method-call-exp should call a
function like expval->obj, in the same way that diff-exp calls
expval->num.
